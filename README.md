# Version 1.0
Version blah blah


## Getting started
1. Change all the files in the `data` directory to match the data model of your app.

1. Routes are in `app.js`, not in `server.js`. This is so our tests will not launch a server every time.

## HARD MODE: Override default queries

```js
// OPTIONALLY pass in new queries to override defaults

const authRoutes = createAuthRoutes({
    selectUser(email) {
        return client.query(`
            SELECT id, email, hash
            FROM users
            WHERE email = $1;
        `,
        [email]
        ).then(result => result.rows[0]);
    },
    insertUser(user, hash) {
        console.log(user);
        return client.query(`
            INSERT into users (email, hash)
            VALUES ($1, $2)
            RETURNING id, email;
        `,
        [user.email, hash]
        ).then(result => result.rows[0]);
    }
});
```

NOTES:
edit data files to reflect the location object from weather api.

add display name to the auth routes as another version?
